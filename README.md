### Hiya, I'm John!

#### Nice to meet you.

Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll be brief!

As a developer I care a lot about:
 - Automated testing - Anything that isn't tested is legacy ðŸ§ª
 - CI/CD - 4 releases in a year isn't enough ðŸ”§
 - Clean code - but let's be pragmatic about it ðŸ§¼
 - Excellent solutons ðŸ‘Œ

You may contact me through my website [website](https://jmgundersen.net).  
This is also where you can find my [blog](https://www.jmgundersen.net/blog) - this is where you'll find what I'm up to as well.
