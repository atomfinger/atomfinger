### Hiya, I'm John!

#### Nice to meet you.

Don’t worry, I’ll be brief!

As a developer I care a lot about:
 - Automated testing 🧪 (Anything that isn't tested is legacy)
 - CI/CD 🔧 (4 releases in a year isn't enough)
 - Clean code 🧼 (but let's be pragmatic about it)
 - Excellent solutons 👌 (not up for debate)

You may contact me through my website [website](https://jmgundersen.net).  
This is also where you can find my [blog](https://www.jmgundersen.net/blog) - this is where you'll find what I'm up to as well.

If you're the kind of person which uses LinkedIn you can find that [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-mikael-gundersen/).
